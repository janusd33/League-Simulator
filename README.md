# League-Simulator
Project for Advanced Object-Oriented and Functional Programming made by Sebastian Deręgowski and Dawid Janus.

This is a simple simulator of a league tournament. User chooses 4 clubs to play in it. Simulation of every game is based on probability of actions (change of ball 
possesion, fouls, yellow cards, red cards, shoots, shoots on target, goals). Each team consists of 11 players whose statistics are based on FIFA 21. Thanks to that
the results are truly realistic. Comments during simulation are similar to those from Flashscore.com. For each game user can make a bid and pick an expected
result. Odds are created dependent from team statistics. Apart from that user can see a league table, fixtures and all tournament statistics (top goalscorers,
assistants, most frequent fouled/fouling players etc.).

Screens from simulator may be found in PDF file.
